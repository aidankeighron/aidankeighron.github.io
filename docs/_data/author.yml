    I am the Lead Programmer at APS Data Technologies working on Machine Learning and Vision Processing. I do robotics in my free time as well as software development. I am the Team Manager of Bad Conflict Robotics, a combat robotics team that competes in ant-weight robotics competitions. I love math and science, especially physics, and learning new programming languages.
