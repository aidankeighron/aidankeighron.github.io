# Project Overview

I use PID's a lot in robotics, so I created a visuialzer of how a PID works to make it easier to explain. Ill go over what PID's are, how they work, and show the code that I used to visuialize them. As A bonus at the end I will talk about enhansing your PID's using a trapaziodial motion profile.

The code shown here has been modified to make it easier to explain. If you would like to check it out, the full code is available on GitHub: [PID Visulizer](https://github.com/aidankeighron/PID-Visualizer){:target="\_blank"}
