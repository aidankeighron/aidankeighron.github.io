# Project Overview

I often need to save large groups of tabs either for later use or for use on another device. Usually I will save every tab to a bookmarked folder, but this is tedious and unnecessary. So I created this chrome extension to make that easier.

The code shown here has been modified to make it easier to explain. If you would like to check it out, the full code is available on GitHub: [Group Extension](https://github.com/aidankeighron/Group-Extension){:target="\_blank"}

# Installation

The easiest way is to install it through the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/group-management/mipeplimdkiijcfjjkdgkhemfcpoaied?hl=en&authuser=0){:target="\_blank"}. Alternatively, you can download the source code for the extension. To add it to your extensions. Go to <a href='chrome://extensions/' target='_blank'>chrome://extensions/</a> (turn on developer mode in the top right corner if you don't already have it on) and select "Load unpacked". This should open a file prompt where you can select the folder for the extension. Once you have loaded the extension, you are all good to go.
* NOTE: You will not be able to transfer group data between synced devices without installing it as a chrome extension
